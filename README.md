******Please be sure read the in-game warning!  (Hopefully it will provide some laughter for your day!)********


The game is a simple txt based game showcasing the skills I've learned so far on my journey.

The content is original not generated from a tutorial but crafted from tools I have at my disposal.  I'm finally at a stage where I feel comfortable working with functions, passing variables by name and by reference.  Figuring out how to implement loop structures in different ways.  Next step will be underlying data patterns and structures adding more complexity to the game.  Maybe even port to a web app and then onto a phone app.  If for nothing else my own progress.

I doubt anyone will see this....but if you do....be kind..and..rewind to the days when you first started programming.

I'm open to and appreciate feedback regarding the logic, the overall design, better techniques.  Anything to help an early software developer.

Thanks for stopping by.   Now it's time to Grab your Beers and Get Dem Deers!
